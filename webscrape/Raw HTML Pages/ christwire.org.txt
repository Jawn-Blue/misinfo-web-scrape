ChristWire is reloading.

In the year 2016, the unthinkable happened:  the reign of Barack Obama I and the potential reign of Hillary Clinton came to a complete halt
Through what could only be described as a miracle from the heavens (if you look East when praying), a man first mocked by everyone ascended to lead the country into what was supposed to be a Golden Age of Morality.
But alas, things are not going as expected.

The world is again in peril.  Americans fight over every possible thing, at the behest of divisive radicals who have invested and invaded every nook and cranny of culture.
Logic is defied for saving the face of politics.  Churches full of decent people think and post memes of reprehenisble nature.  Political leaders invoke the very populism and divisive rhetoric that lead humanity to global wars.  
Science is ridiculed.  Decent moral people are mocked.  Wild-eyed outliers believe every word that they have been told to disagree with, no matter how logical, is a reason to grab a weapon and protest the advice to wear a mask.  

In times of such calamity and chaos, helpers must arise.  That is where the community of ChristWire has again heard the call to arise.
