We did L4 and it certainly did cause financial hardship and it most certainly have us time to slow the infection rate and reduce the mortality rate. We lost 19 people and have a small new case number currently. The question is what could have happened if we did nothing and is the cost of locking down worth the possible lives saved. What is a human life worth and if it was your life or my life sitting on a resperator in some infectious disease ICU ward would we think differently. Would the coffee shop being opened where we contracted the disease really seem like a civil liberty that was not worth forgoing for a few weeks. I completely agree we need to look at the situation and consider all the possibilities both now and retrospectively but I prefer to listen to the scientists and go with their advice because the average politician from historical evidence can not be trusted to really have our well being at heart.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Darren","url":""}},{"@type":"Comment","@id":"https:\/\/www.foreignpolicyjournal.com\/2020\/04\/25\/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-about-fatality-rates\/#Comment10","dateCreated":"2020-05-01 21:15:13","description":"Nobody disagrees about the need to flatten the curve.

Non - radiating thermal imaging has proven to be more accurate for detecting tumors since more blood travels to tumors. Fibroid tumors are common and come and go for those who are prone to them but are benign, non-cancerous. Proposing that cancer can be cured with deadly radiation and toxic chemo-therapy is ludicrous, because the cancer is in the individual and the radiation also kills the individual. So, technically, yes, they kill cancer, but they also kills people. This is outright fraud perpetrated by the medical mafia. If someone doesn't care that people are being murdered for money, perhaps they should care that the government and their insurance companies are spending trillions of dollars to do it, which adds to the national debt and increases their insurance programs. Prostate cancer can be extremely slow growing. My grandfather lived with it healthy and untreated for over 40 years, unaffected. With men, there is often a push to get men treated for prostate cancer leading to deadly side effects as well as impotency and incontinence.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Andrea Iravani","url":""}},{"@type":"Comment","@id":"https:\/\/www.foreignpolicyjournal.com\/2020\/03\/01\/who-experimenting-on-african-children-without-informed-consent\/#Comment6","dateCreated":"2020-03-04 15:00:20","description":"Or they could just hand out mosquito nets and tonic water, and hyssop instead, but there isn't any profit in that for the medical mafia!

Sutter Medical Center, which is located in Sacramento, California, came in second place by earning $271.9 million.

He is someone that they can easily manipulate. His family really ought to insist that he withdraw from the race, not only for the good of America, but for his own safety and well being as well. To allow this to continue is extremely irresponsible! They will be able to lie to him and tell him that he signed things that he didn't sign.

Growing up in America, the battles fought between the Palestinians and Jews in the region were reduced to black and white photographs of people throwing stones accross borders in many instances. The Zionists controlled the narrative in America, for the most part. The majority of Americans have personally known Zionists, but the majority of Americans have not personally known Palestinians, which gives the Zionists an extreme psychological edge and advantage in the battle of hearts and minds. - I know this Zionist person, verses -  I  do not know this Palestinian photograph. As strange and as illogical as that may seem, that is the way that the brain processes things, particularly at a young age, when I started reading about this at a very young age.\n\nThe internet has changed this. We now see the videos of heart wrenching tragedies of the Palestinians which we had not been exposed to by resources that simply couldn't portray the level of human suffering caused even if they wanted to portray it because it is too strong to be captured merely by words and still photographs off in a distant place.\n\nThere must be an effort by familis in America to showwhat is taking place in Palestine at a parentally decided appropriate age. School boards in America and the West must insist that their story is taught in the history books in school as well. There must also be a refocussing on the Palestinian genocide on college campuses throughout the West.\n\nThe Palestinians must increase their online presence if possible, and must organize independently of political parties who have failed to serve them.\n\nIsrael announced a new war strategy today combining technology and \"intelligence\" called Momentum using apps, overlooking the fact that both their hearts and their minds are in the wrong places and no app or technology, or spy program will ever change that.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Andrea Iravani","url":""}}]},{"@type":"NewsArticle","@id":"https:\/\/www.foreignpolicyjournal.com\/2020\/02\/13\/toward-virus-crossroads\/","headline":"Toward Virus Crossroads?","url":"https:\/\/www.foreignpolicyjournal.com\/2020\/02\/13\/toward-virus-crossroads\/","datePublished":"2020-02-13","dateModified":"2020-03-06","mainEntityOfPage":"https:\/\/www.foreignpolicyjournal.com\/2020\/02\/13\/toward-virus-crossroads\/","author":{"@type":"Person","@id":"https:\/\/www.foreignpolicyjournal.com\/author\/dan-steinbock\/#Person","name":"Dan Steinbock","url":"https:\/\/www.foreignpolicyjournal.com\/author\/dan-steinbock\/","description":"Dr. Dan Steinbock is the founder of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.differencegroup.net\/\">Difference Group<\/a> and has served at the India, China and America Institute (USA), the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies (China), and the EU Center (Singapore).","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","@id":"https:\/\/www.foreignpolicyjournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/dan-steinbock-1-96x96.jpg","url":"https:\/\/www.foreignpolicyjournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/dan-steinbock-1-96x96.jpg","height":96,"width":96}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Foreign Policy Journal","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","@id":"https:\/\/www.foreignpolicyjournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/FPJ-logo-bw-globe-banner.png","url":"https:\/\/www.foreignpolicyjournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/FPJ-logo-bw-globe-banner.png","width":600,"height":60}},"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","@id":"https:\/\/www.foreignpolicyjournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/coronavirus.jpg","url":"https:\/\/www.foreignpolicyjournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/coronavirus.jpg","height":607,"width":1080},"wordCount":741,"keywords":["China","Coronavirus","Health"],"commentCount":2,"comment":[{"@type":"Comment","@id":"https:\/\/www.foreignpolicyjournal.com\/2020\/02\/13\/toward-virus-crossroads\/#Comment1","dateCreated":"2020-03-03 19:48:58","description":"More deadly and life threatenning than COVID19 is CVIP, Afluenza, the symptoms of this life treanning parasite violating other people's boundaries which include personal property, the human rights of the individual, and the body and life of the individual.

Here is the breakdown:\nThis 56-minute video is condensed from Highwire for easy sharing with your state Representatives, Senators, and US Congressmen and women. Markers are below for skipping ahead.\n\n2:00 Dr. Heidi Larson, PhD, Director of the Vaccine Confidence Project says the biggest factor in vaccine hesitancy is vaccine safety.\n\n4:26 Dr. Larson says that doctors and nurses are \u201cvery wobbly\u201d and \u201cstarting to question the safety of vaccines,\u201d and it\u2019s a \u201chuge problem.\u201d\n\n6:20 Dr. Larson admits doctors don\u2019t have confidence in vaccine safety to stand up mothers asking questions. Doctors only got a \u201chalf day of vaccine instruction in medical school.\u201d\n\n8:06 Dr. Larson admits that the WHO\u2019s issue with social media is not vaccine \u201cmisinformation,\u201d but that the information \u201cseeds doubt.\u201d\n\n10:24 Dr. Larson admits that global health replaced natural immunity with dependence on vaccine-induced immunity on the \u201cassumption that populations would cooperate.\u201d People got the 6 vaccines in the 1960s-1980s, but now it\u2019s a problem. But since they got the world dependent on vaccines, global health has no choice but to continue pushing vaccines.\n\n13:10 Dr. Larson says there is a lot of safety science needed, they can\u2019t keep repurposing old science that isn\u2019t relevant to the new problem that vaccines are causing.\n\n16:04 Dr. Marion Gruber, FDA admits that vaccines NEED to have safety monitoring specifically tailored to the one vaccine under consideration. Risk management plans WILL need to take into account all of the safety evidence they have. These safety measures do not exist.\n\n19:40 Dr. Martin Howell Friede, WHO cautions vaccine makers from using adjuvants because they cause adverse events. If makers must use an adjuvant, they should use an old one with a \u201chistory\u201d (that allows the vaccine maker to say the adverse event wasn\u2019t the adjuvant.) The new adjuvants will be accused of causing adverse events, but there will be no new vaccines without adjuvants. His solution is to build confidence, not make them safer.\n\n25:15 Professor Stephen Evans says \u201cIt seems that adjuvants multiply the immunogenicity of the antigens they\u2019re added to; they multiply the reactogenicity, so it\u2019s not unexpected they multiply the adverse reactions. Is my thinking is correct?\u201d\n\n27:22 Dr. Friede, says the \u201cmajor health concerns they see are the long term effects of vaccines,\u201d not the sore knot on your arm. Adjuvants act differently with every antigen, and impurities. We need larger studies and we need to measure the appropriate things.\n\n31:28 Dr. Friede, admits that it\u2019s necessary that we figure out how adjuvants work so they can start to asses how plausible it is that adjuvants are causing the major health concerns.\n\n31:38 Dr. David Kaslow, Center for Vaccine Innovation and Access admits that they do their studies on very small groups of people. Says that \u201cone of the things they need to invest in\u201d are better biomarkers and mechanistic understanding of how adjuvants work so they can understand the adverse events.\n\n32:25 Dr. Gruber states that one issue that complicates the safety evaluation is the length of follow-up because the longer you study the group, the more \u201ccoincidental\u201d adverse events pop up. Giving adjuvants to the elderly may do nothing, but be reactive in younger people.\n\n38:13 Dr. Kaslow, \u201cComing down the pike relatively quickly is a new target population for us in vaccines: maternal immunization. We don\u2019t have a strong pharmaco-epidemiologic baseline in that target population to say \u2018is this an expected adverse event due to pregnancy, or is this the vaccine?\u2019 We need an investment in that study so we don\u2019t derail our pregnancy vaccines as they go into low-resource settings.\u201d\n\n40:07 CDC ACIP meeting vaccinating pregnant women is \u201coff-label.\u201d\n\n41:24 The FDA admitted they have no studies about vaccines and pregnancy.\n\n41:55 Nigerian doctor asks if there are any safety studies on injecting multiple vaccines, from multiple makers, with multiple adjuvants, into a child at once.\n\n44:12 ACIP meeting, the CDC admits they have no data on injecting multiple adjuvants at once, but they recommend it anyway, in different limbs.\n\n45:22 Dr. Robert Chen admits no, they don\u2019t have data on injecting multiple adjuvants at this time, they need to link databases together to \u201cstart to answer these types of questions.\u201d\n\n50:01 Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, Chief Scientist with the WHO, says in a commercial that vaccine safety tracking is robust, and examining the data lets them promptly address problems. They are \u201cthoroughly monitored.\u201d\n\n52:40 Dr. Swaminathan admits, \u201cWe really don\u2019t have very good safety monitoring systems in many countries. We can\u2019t give answers about the deaths. We need to put mechanisms in place to monitor what\u2019s going on. With many drugs, we only learn about adverse events after they are introduced to the populations.\u201d","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"codetalker","url":"http:\/\/wordpresscomaddress9087.wordpress.com"}},{"@type":"Comment","@id":"https:\/\/www.foreignpolicyjournal.com\/2020\/02\/11\/fact-check-who-scientist-caught-lying-to-public-about-vaccine-safety\/#Comment9","dateCreated":"2020-02-11 21:05:36","description":"The Medical Mafia lies frequently, just parrotting the last information from various pharmacuetical companies and medical testing and medical deivce companies.

It is the Paestinian people who suffer the most barbaric atrocities in modern history, far surpassing the Nazi Third Reich's victimization of Jews, in terms of the longevity of the racial extermination camps and policies, in effect for over an entire century of rapicity, ethnic cleansing, racism, and slow motion genocide.\n\nThe genocide on the Paestinians is the greatest failing in modern history. It is official policy that is nothing other than that of a narcisstic, sadistic, and psychopathic nature. It is a brazen and demonic sense of entitlement by the Israelis and the West that supports them to treat the Palestinians as sub-humans. It is disgusting gluttony and covetness in the most exteme form possible.\n\nI do not understand why it is that the Zionist minority in the West has had so much ability to manipulate political discourse and policy in their favor when all of the facts prove them wrong. Perhaps it is the result of the ineptitude of many that they attack, or more likely than not, a lack of courage to stand up to a paper tiger. The Israelis must be reminded that they are both surrounded, and outnumbered by enemies of their own making. Remind them that in the face of it all, they are nothing but screaming paper tigers.\n\nThe UN and ICC appear to be taking steps in the right directions. Courts in Texas have as well. Abby Martin is suing the state of Georgia for refusing to sign a pledge of allegiance to Israel.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Andrea Iravani","url":""}}]},{"@type":"NewsArticle","@id":"https:\/\/www.foreignpolicyjournal.com\/2020\/01\/31\/pioneering-effort-to-contain-coronavirus-outbreak-in-megacities\/","headline":"Pioneering Effort to Contain Coronavirus Outbreak in Megacities","url":"https:\/\/www.foreignpolicyjournal.com\/2020\/01\/31\/pioneering-effort-to-contain-coronavirus-outbreak-in-megacities\/","datePublished":"2020-01-31","dateModified":"2020-01-31","mainEntityOfPage":"https:\/\/www.foreignpolicyjournal.com\/2020\/01\/31\/pioneering-effort-to-contain-coronavirus-outbreak-in-megacities\/","author":{"@type":"Person","@id":"https:\/\/www.foreignpolicyjournal.com\/author\/dan-steinbock\/#Person","name":"Dan Steinbock","url":"https:\/\/www.foreignpolicyjournal.com\/author\/dan-steinbock\/","description":"Dr. Dan Steinbock is the founder of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.differencegroup.net\/\">Difference Group<\/a> and has served at the India, China and America Institute (USA), the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies (China), and the EU Center (Singapore).","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","@id":"https:\/\/www.foreignpolicyjournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/dan-steinbock-1-96x96.jpg","url":"https:\/\/www.foreignpolicyjournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/dan-steinbock-1-96x96.jpg","height":96,"width":96}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Foreign Policy Journal","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","@id":"https:\/\/www.foreignpolicyjournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/FPJ-logo-bw-globe-banner.png","url":"https:\/\/www.foreignpolicyjournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/FPJ-logo-bw-globe-banner.png","width":600,"height":60}},"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","@id":"https:\/\/www.foreignpolicyjournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/wuhan-coronavirus.jpg","url":"https:\/\/www.foreignpolicyjournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/wuhan-coronavirus.jpg","height":605,"width":1075},"wordCount":1123,"keywords":["China","Economy","Health","Trade","US Foreign Policy","WHO"]},{"@type":"NewsArticle","@id":"https:\/\/www.foreignpolicyjournal.com\/2020\/01\/31\/you-came-to-create-change\/","headline":"You Came to Create Change","url":"https:\/\/www.foreignpolicyjournal.com\/2020\/01\/31\/you-came-to-create-change\/","datePublished":"2020-01-31","dateModified":"2020-01-31","mainEntityOfPage":"https:\/\/www.foreignpolicyjournal.com\/2020\/01\/31\/you-came-to-create-change\/","author":{"@type":"Person","@id":"https:\/\/www.foreignpolicyjournal.com\/author\/mats-svensson\/#Person","name":"Mats Svensson","url":"https:\/\/www.foreignpolicyjournal.com\/author\/mats-svensson\/","description":"Mats Svensson, a former Swedish diplomat working on the staff of SIDA, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, has been  following the ongoing occupation of Palestine since 2003.

Parcelesus was the first to realize that diseases were caused by external things outside of the body, however, the entire psychiatric industry is living in the dark ages and is still behaving like barber surgeons! If you and Rand could please educate your fellow practioners as well as the FDA and congress that this is not only costing people and the government trillions of dollars a year, but is based on outright junk science that causes more psychiatric disorders than it is marketed to cure, the world would be eternally grateful!","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Andrea Iravani","url":""}},{"@type":"Comment","@id":"https:\/\/www.foreignpolicyjournal.com\/2020\/01\/30\/even-the-most-progressive-u-s-foreign-policy-blames-foreigners\/#Comment3","dateCreated":"2020-02-26 17:37:53","description":"The use of cookies does not \"override\" your security.

If it was an NDA used specifically for protecting the information about the voters that they contacted, that would be understandable, but with all of the past election rigging as well as current attempts to rig the election against Sanders, volunteers should not be forbidden from whistleblowwing about state party corruption. Afterall, it is called the Democratic Party, which we learned in 2016 was nothing more than false advertising and a complete misnomer. It is absolutely disgusting!\n\nUnfortunately, Sanders seems to be becoming more and more flexible to capitulating his own set of values, just like all presidents have done. In the past, I truly beleived that he was above that. I'm not sure what happenned to him after 2016, but it doesn't look very optimistic for voters getting someone truly revolutionary with Sanders, unfortunately.\n\nHere are some of Sanders bending like a willow statements. I knew that he had supported the war in Kossovo, but has expressed disapproval of all of the other wars.\nhttps:\/\/www.globalresearch.ca\/sanders-geopolitical-issues\/5703987","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Andrea Iravani","url":""}},{"@type":"Comment","@id":"https:\/\/www.foreignpolicyjournal.com\/2020\/01\/30\/even-the-most-progressive-u-s-foreign-policy-blames-foreigners\/#Comment8","dateCreated":"2020-02-22 00:27:57","description":"Sputnik just reported that U.S. intelligence is warning Bernie that Russia is trying toinfiltrate the Sanders campaign.
