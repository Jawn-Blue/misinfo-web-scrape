<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-34" height="406" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px" src="http://www.freewoodpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tips-to-Help-You-Become-a-Better-Lover.jpg" srcset="http://www.freewoodpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tips-to-Help-You-Become-a-Better-Lover.jpg 722w, http://www.freewoodpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tips-to-Help-You-Become-a-Better-Lover-300x169.jpg 300w" width="722"/></p>
<p>There are several tips that you can use to help you to <a href="https://www.askmen.com/top_10/dating/top-10-simple-ways-to-become-a-better-lover.html">become a better lover</a>.</p>
<p>Eye Contact</p>
<p>The first tip is to have a presence with your partner. This means that you need to be able to respond to all of the needs of your partner at every moment. This also means that you need to keep the eye contact the whole time with your partner. This is the best way to show that you are paying attention to the person who is in the bed with you. You will also need to pay attention to the sexual experience.</p>
<p>Exercise</p>
<p>The second tip is to have a good exercise regime. This is going to help you to improve your sex life because it is going to release the mood boosters inside of your body. Therefore, it will increase your desire for sex and your sex drive. The exercise is also going to help to encourage the production of testosterone and will prime your body so that you are going to be able to go for a longer amount of time since you are going to have stronger arms and back. All you need to do is about a job for about twenty minutes or free weights at your local gym.</p>
<p>Sleep</p>
<p>The third tip is to make sure that you prioritize your sleep. This means that if you are stressed out when you dont get enough sleep, then you are not going to have a good sex drive. This just means that you need to ensure that you are getting at least eight hours of sleep every night. This is because this is when the testosterone inside of the body is going to be produced. Therefore, if you dont get enough sleep, then the body is not going to be able to make enough testosterone to help with your desire for sex.</p>
<p>Muscles</p>
<p>The fourth tip is to tune up the sex muscles. Basically, these are going to be the areas that are going to be used the most when you are involved in the sexual play. These areas are going to include the lower back, your abs, the forearms, and the pelvic floor muscles. Most of the time, the pelvic floor area is going to be the weakest. This is why it is suggested that you do Kegel exercises to help with these muscles. And the best part is that you are only going to do about twice a week and you are going to be good.</p>
<p>Expert</p>
<p>The fifth tip is to become an expert in your own sexual pleasure. This means that you are going to know when you need to speed up and slow down or just switch gears if things are working out. This is when you need to think about all of the things that are going to make you climax. This means thinking about the pressure, sensation, and speed of the actions so that you are going to be satisfied with your sex life. It might be a good idea to write down all of the things that you like to do or the things that you want to do in the future.</p>
<p>Mouth</p>
<p>The sixth tip is to use your mouth to <a href="https://www.readersdigest.ca/health/relationships/6-ways-better-lover/">communicate with your partner</a>. Most of the time, your sex life is going to be last thing that you want to talk about. This is when the list is going to come in handy. It is going to take a little bit of effort in order to help to improve your self life. Therefore, you are going to need to talk about all of the things that you like, dislike, and that you would like to do in the future. This is going to allow you to know what is going to turn your partner off and on.</p>
<p>Give/Receive</p>
<p>The seventh tip is that you want to receive something, then you have to be willing to give something. But there can be a lot of anxiety when it comes to giving pleasure to someone else. Most of the time, this is going to because the person was raised in the culture where sex was shamed. If you are having a hard time with this, then you will need to do where there are not going to be any distractions like the TV or cell phone. Then it is going to be a good idea to light some candles, and put on some soft music to calm your partner down.</p>

<p>Understanding One Another</p>
<p>Relationships can be difficult even if you do get along with your partner, but there are some things that you can do to change the situation. All relationships are going to require you to listen to your partner. If you do not take the time to listen to what your partner is saying it can be very difficult to sustain a relationship.<br/>
The following presents some tips for handling those hard relationships and the things that make the relationships difficult.</p>
<p>Arguing Over Money</p>
<p>One of the things that tends to make any relationship hard is arguments about money. When couples have arguments about money it becomes difficult for them to see what the other person values. If one person is interested in material possessions, and someone else does not value these things it can cause a huge strain on the relationship. In order to get a better feel on how you can improve your relationship and minimize your arguments you should have open discussions about what you think you should spend as a couple. It does you no good to fight on these issues.</p>
<p>Outside Temptations</p>
<p>Another thing that tends to come up quite often and relationships is the outside<br/>
temptations of someone else that you may be attracted to. This can be a difficult one, and it will make some people question if they even want to be in a relationship. What you have to do in these situations is have a talk and make a decision. You must know that there are rules. Some people allow flirting with someone as long as it does not going overboard. There are others that may not tolerate it any type of flirting or communication with anyone else. You must establish what you will not accept. If you never get to this point where you talk about it this is always going to be a barrier for growing together as a couple.</p>
<p>There are some couples that have open relationships, but this is not the majority of relationships that exist. In most cases people that get into a relationship are looking for something that is monogamous. It is up to you to decide if this is the road that you would like to travel. If these are things that you consider to be problems you should make arrangements to end the relationship because it can only cause more hurt and pain as your relationship progresses. You do not want to be in a place where you are struggling or trying to build a better relationship with a partner that cannot be faithful.</p>
<p>Opposites Attract and Annoy</p>
<p>It has been said that opposites attract. What no one may have told these couples is that opposite personalities can also annoy. There are tons of cases where people become attracted to someone that is different from them, and that may work for a while. When they become closer, however, they will discover that it is easy to become annoyed with this type of partner.</p>
<p>If you are someone that is not seeing eye to eye with your partner it may have something to do with your upbringing. You may be a college graduate that is with a blue collar worker. There are a variety of things that can result in a gap in your relationship and the way that you see the world. For problems like this you should take time to work on the areas that you have in common. You should explore new things and consider new things that may become common interest that you have together.</p>
<p>Outside Friends</p>
<p>At times you may find yourself in situations where your outside friends can interfere with your relationship. They may be giving you advice on what to do when it comes to your relationship. You may also find yourself in a predicament where you want to spend time going to different functions and events with your friends. If you have a partner that is very clingy this may become a problem.</p>
<p>If this is something that has arisen in <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/compassion-matters/201402/5-things-try-giving-relationship">your relationship</a> you must discuss boundaries and ways that you can spend more time together. No spouse wants to be neglected. By the same token, no one wants to feel like they are a prisoner that cannot leave the home. Couples must take time to talk about this and engage in conversations where they come to a compromise. You may not go out all the time, but it is good to spend some time together.</p>

There is no need for you to spend time alone when you can spend time with women that are already ready to have a great time.</p>

<p>Talking to women is something that can be overwhelming at first but you get better at it with practice. The first thing that you have to understand is that there is no way to be with every single women. There are going to be women that reject you regardless of how attractive you are and how respectfully that you <a href="https://theartofcharm.com/approaching-a-woman/approach-girl-public/">approach her</a>. But there are surefire ways to get dates with women who happen to be single. There are plenty of women who want men to approach them, but are too nervous to do anything. Thats why theres no shame in giving it a try.</p>
<p>If you want to know How to pickup chicks you should look at the location. You should use different tactics to talk to a woman that you would meet at a church from one that you might meet at a party. This is something that could be a talking point on your date and find great things that they get to find. There are a total amount of things that you could have a conversation about. Though, it could just be light topics when you actually go on the date. Use this method at your discretion.</p>
<p>There are somethings that you shouldnt say while introducing yourself to that woman. The first thing is that you shouldnt say anything degrading or misogynistic if its for comedic intent. If she has something that is cultural or deals with sensitive subject matter, you should avoid talking about that. You should make your intentions clear before you intend on going on a date with a woman. That will make sure that no one is upset when you decide to move forward. Its something that will save the both of you a lot of time. That is something that the both of you should want.</p>
<p>Pick-up lines seem to be the most popular method on How to pickup chicks. They are incredibly playful and humorous, which will set the mood. It will tell a little bit about yourself and usually, the cheesier the better. It is something that will make her laugh and will usually make her more comfortable with talking to you. Now if she likes it, you could continue talking to her or you could make arrangements for your date. The option is left up to your consideration. Its a great option for newcomers and tends to not offend people.</p>
<p>There are just little things that woman might want to hear. You may notice that she spent a lot of time on her make up and she needs to feel noticed. Perhaps, you could give her that attention and she feels better. That is positive reinforcement that others could always need. You could find the things that make her feel comforted besides in a physical essence. It will make her feel like you are someone who makes her day better. That is something that should feel good about doing because you are actively making someone life better in comfort.</p>
<p>There is also something known as cuffing season. This happens during the colder times in the year and lets you make sure that someone will want to be with you. You will see the things that let you be in a relationship. Bringing this concept up to her might make her feel like she is in comfort with you. She will at least have to consider it because of the concept of staying warm. You get to enjoy her company as well as home cooked meals and productive discussions. Its worth giving a try for people who havent tried it.</p>
<p>The last one is to just be yourself. It is the most cliche one, but it is the one where you will be likely to be happy. You get to tell people all about yourself and you get to learn about them. You get to learn about the person who you are talking to. You should go to something that you are legitimately interested in and propose the idea of a date. It is something that will be productive for the both of you. It gives you a chance to see a different side of that person and you to just get some time to be friends. She will likely be open to this concept because she also wants people to talk about these important things. It allows comfort on both sides because you get to relate more. Someone who met wants to talk more to you because they feel like theyre not alone.</p>
