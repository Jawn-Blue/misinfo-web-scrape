<div class="entry-caption"><p><h3 style="text-align: center;">Pioneers of bank</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Holy priests hated Jews, and villainous Italians were the pioneers of banking. They made a lot of money from interest on loans, and they became more and more greedy.</em></p>
<p><strong>Tempel was the first bank</strong><br/>
18th century BCE: In ancient Babylonia and Egypt, temples were pre-eminent places to store valuables, for no one dared to rob the sacred buildings. Babylonian priests also lent money in the time of King Hammurabi (18th century BC). The Babylonians were the first with an actual bank. 5th century BC: The ancient Greeks were merchants and needed a solid banking system. Therefore, in the 5th century BC, Athenian businessmen. Their money to the local bank, where they received a guarantee certificate with which they could collect it at another bank. This way they did not have to lug around heavy money boxes that could easily be stolen. The Greek banks also lent money to their customers and exchanged foreign currency.

<p><strong>Jews practiced prohibited professions</strong><br/>
Middle-Ages: The medieval Catholic Church did not consider the profession of money lender appropriate for a Christian. In the 12th century, the Pope forbade all Christians to charge interest, preventing them from earning money from banking. However, the European monarchs had to borrow a lot of money to build and wage war, so they instructed the Jews, who were not forbidden by the Churchâs prohibition, to lend money and in return offered protection. Most crafts were forbidden to Jews, and by lending money they earned a living. Because of their banking activities, they were looked at even more with the neck by the Christian population.</p>
<p><strong>The modern bank originated in Italy</strong><br/>
14th century: With creative accounting, Italian merchants circumvented the ecclesiastical prohibition on interest. In the 14th and 15th centuries, Northern Italian merchants succeeded in taking over much of the Jewish banking activities. They were not allowed to charge interest, but the Italians circumvented this prohibition by describing the interest as âgiftâ or âreward for riskâ in their accounts. In Genoa, Siena, and especially Florence, the benches sprang up like mushrooms. In Florence, the De âMedici family made a fortune in loans. This gave her the say in the city and was even allowed to supply a number of popes. The Italiansâ financial empires are seen as the forerunners of modern banking.</p>
<p><strong>Nationalization in the 17th century</strong><br/>
17th century: In 1661 Stockholms Banco was the first bank in Europe to issue banknotes instead of coins. But the company issued more notes than it had in silver and copper and went bankrupt. The state intervened and took over the bankâs estate in 1668. The institution that emerged from this still exists and is today Swedenâs national bank.</p>
<p><strong>9,000 US banks go bankrupt</strong><br/>
1929: Black Thursday, as is known on October 24, 1929. On that day, stock prices on the stock exchange on Wall Street in New York took a dive. Hundreds of thousands of Americans had invested in stocks, often with borrowed money, and that seemed like a safe investment. But the bubble burst and the <a href="/2020/06/03/financial-and-economic-crisis-ten-years-ago/">financial crisis</a> that followed killed 9,000 US banks.</p>
<p><strong>Global financial crisis</strong><br/>
Until a few years ago, the international investment bank Lehman Brothers had $ 691 billion in assets and employed 26,000 people. But the bank owed its success to high-risk loans, and 2008 went wrong. The financial giant went bankrupt, and a global economic crisis was the result. European pension funds lost billions of euros. Lehman Brothers were the largest, but by no means the only, bank to collapse during this crisis, and its effects are still felt today.</p>

<div class="entry-caption"><p><p>It is a common scenario among average individuals to apply a loan at <em><u>accreditloan.com</u></em> when they run short of money to pay their dues and needs an immediate backup. Things are quite difficult already for an individual. But what about for an entire country? For most of the developing economies, <strong>the only possible way for them to keep progress is by issuing sovereign debt.</strong> So how countries are dealing with their national debt while also surviving to grow?</p>
<p>Several countries, particularly the developing economies are <u>issuing debt in an effort to raise funds</u>. This is the same to how a business takes a loan in financing new project or how a family may be applying for a mortgage. The only difference in this analogy is the size. Sovereign debt loan will most probably cover billions of dollars while business or personal loans will just be a tiny fraction of this amount.</p>

<h3><strong>Understanding Sovereign Debt</strong></h3>
<p>Sovereign debt is basically the promise of the government in paying the money it borrowed. Itâs <strong>the value of bonds that are issued by the countryâs government</strong>. An obvious difference between sovereign debt as well as <a href="/2020/06/03/financial-and-economic-crisis-ten-years-ago/">government debt</a> is the fact that the letter is being issued in domestic currency while the former is issued using foreign currency. The loan is being guaranteed by the country of issue.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Before going for a sovereign debt of the government, the investors carefully determine the involve risks of the investment. Sometimes, the debt of a country like the US is deemed risk free while debt of developing or emerging countries carries bigger risks. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>There are multiple variables that come into play just as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The plan of the government in repaying the debt</strong></li>
<li><strong>The possibility of the country to default and;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Government stability</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>At times, this risk analysis is almost the same to how corporate debt is performed. Though when it comes to sovereign debt, the investors may at times left more exposed. Due to the political and economic risks for sovereign debt outweighs the debt from developed countries, <em>the debt is usually given with a rating below the safe AA and AAA status and might be deemed to be lower than the investment grade.</em></p>
<h4><strong>What if the Country Defaulted?</strong></h4>
<p><strong><u>Defaulting on sovereign debt might be a lot complicated than defaulting on corporate debts</u></strong>. This is simply because of the fact that domestic assets canât be seized in paying the funds back. Instead, the terms of debt is renegotiated, and usually leaving the lender in unfavorable position.</p>

<div class="entry-caption"><p><p>Investors are gradually turning their attention to binary options trading instead of venturing into stock markets, because <strong><a href="http://sentinelblog.com/2020/04/16/economics-and-finance-are-interchangeably-used-but-separate-subjects/">world economies</a></strong> are still in a limbo.</p>
<p>Obviously, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have struck nearly all industries in many countries. On the other hand, price per share of those benefiting from the COVID-19 lockdown measures are too high for comfort, at a time when there is still uncertainty on how economic fallouts can be resolved.</p>
<h3><strong>What Makes Binary Options Trading Attractive to Prospectors?</strong></h3>
<p>Binary options trading involves speculating on the future price of an investment asset, e.g. foreign currency, cryptocurrency or precious metal. The method is simple; an investor speculates if his investment asset will reach a price that will generate an expected yield or not.</p>
<p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" class="__youtube_prefs__ epyt-is-override no-lazyload lazyload" data-no-lazy="1" data-origheight="360" data-origwidth="640" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5lUo4vEuAT8?enablejsapi=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;cc_lang_pref=&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;loop=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;autohide=2&amp;theme=dark&amp;color=red&amp;controls=1&amp;" height="360" id="_ytid_20539" title="YouTube player" width="640"></iframe></p>
<p>By the way, this trading method is called binary because an investor has only two propositions to decide on; either a âYesâ or a âNoâ answer on whether he believes his investment asset will hit a price that will yield gains or not.</p>
<p>Outcomes or results are fast because binary options trading transpire within a specific period only, which can expire in as short as 60 seconds. An investorâs yield however, is based on the price he speculated, without any option to sell his investment asset at a potentially higher price. Winnings will come from the investment asset of the binary options trader who speculated on the opposite proposition. In some cases, the broker who offered the binary options trading deal, acts as the opposing party.</p>
<p>Apparently, thereâs a high degree of risk involved, because if the investor is on the losing end of the âYesâ or âNoâ proposition, he stands to lose the asset invested. That is mainly because there is no actual buying and selling involved; only an exchange of price speculations. It is actually similar to placing oneâs investment asset as stake to a gambling proposition to bet on a high or low number.</p>
<h3><strong>Reducing Risks on Binary Options Trading</strong></h3>
<p>If there is a great deal of risks involved, then why is binary options trading gaining popularity?</p>
<p>Apparently, there are ways to reduce risks in trading with binary options, and it starts with choosing the right broker. That being said, the next question that would be posed by those contemplating to participate in binary options trading is, âWho is the right broker?â</p>
<p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" class="__youtube_prefs__ epyt-is-override no-lazyload lazyload" data-no-lazy="1" data-origheight="360" data-origwidth="640" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EuZALv7WfA8?enablejsapi=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;cc_lang_pref=&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;loop=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;autohide=2&amp;theme=dark&amp;color=red&amp;controls=1&amp;" height="360" id="_ytid_11069" title="YouTube player" width="640"></iframe></p>
<p>First off, consider only duly registered brokers offering this type of <strong><a href="http://sentinelblog.com/2019/11/22/where-to-invest-this-decade/">trading in the country</a></strong> where one is located.</p>
<p>Letâs take one of the most popular brokerages offering binary options trading, IQ Option Europe Ltd.at <strong>ipoption.com</strong>. This broker is registered with European Economic Area, the organization of European countries, not necessarily members of the European Union, but involved in facilitating European market trade. IQ Options Europe Ltd. is also registered with the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC), which closely and seriously monitors unfair market trading practices.</p>
<p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" class="__youtube_prefs__ epyt-is-override no-lazyload lazyload" data-no-lazy="1" data-origheight="360" data-origwidth="640" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pfdf5WG9tx0?enablejsapi=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;cc_lang_pref=&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;loop=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;autohide=2&amp;theme=dark&amp;color=red&amp;controls=1&amp;" height="360" id="_ytid_37401" title="YouTube player" width="640"></iframe></p>
<p>The next aspect to look into is if a broker provides prospecting investors with a demo software. That way, customers can practice not only how to trade on futures,but also how to analyze the binary options trading market and the underlying conditions. All of which can help a newbie gain confidence by becoming completely familiar with how trading on binary options work.</p>

<div class="entry-caption"><p><p>Even though finance and economics are presented and taught to be individual disciplines on their own, <strong>these two are actually influencing, informing and interrelate each other</strong>. Investors do care about studies related to these subjects for they can significantly influence the market to certain degree. It is imperative for investors to steer clear on âeither/orâ arguments about finance and economics. Both have valid applications and thus, important.</p>
<p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" class="__youtube_prefs__ epyt-is-override no-lazyload lazyload" data-no-lazy="1" data-origheight="360" data-origwidth="640" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dM_ZEbjb4Yw?enablejsapi=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;cc_lang_pref=&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;loop=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;autohide=2&amp;theme=dark&amp;color=red&amp;controls=1&amp;" height="360" id="_ytid_94210" title="YouTube player" width="640"></iframe></p>
<h3><strong>A Deeper Look for Better Understanding</strong></h3>
<p>Generally speaking, <em>economicsâ attention is more on a broader scale</em> like how a market, region or the entire country is performing. Aside from that, economics are focused on public policy whereas in finance, it is centered more on <em>industry-or-company-specific</em>. Finance on the other hand is centered on how investors and companies are evaluating risk and return. If we are going to go back in history, economics are more theoretical while finance is more practical. Yet, the distinction becomes less pronounced for the past two decades.</p>
<p>The truth is, <strong>the said disciplines may sound converging in some aspects</strong>. Professionals and experts in finance and economics are employed in corporations, financial markets and even the government itself. At some point, there will be a separation but, both are more likely to stay <em>important to investors, markets and economy for the following years</em>.</p>
<h3><strong>Finance</strong></h3>
<p>If we are going to look at finance on different angles, it describes anything that comprises the financial system and the <a href="/2020/02/24/understanding-gdp-and-its-importance-to-a-country/">study of the financial instruments</a>. These elements can include but not limited to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Management</strong></li>
<li><strong>Creation and study of money</strong></li>
<li><strong>Credit</strong></li>
<li><strong>Banking</strong></li>
<li><strong>Investments and;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Liability</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Finance may also be divided into 3 categories similar to public finance, corporate finance and personal finance.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Finance usually focused on studying interest rates, prices, cash flow as well as financial markets. On a broader sense, finance has the tendency of focusing around topics which include time value of money, cost of capital, rates of return, quantification of risks and optimal financial structures.</em></p></blockquote>
<h4><strong>What about Economics?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Economics is more of a social science</strong> and it focused on studying the consumption, distribution and production of goods and services; with the focus of explaining how its agent interacts and how itself works. <em>Economics also have two main branches</em> and these are the:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Macroeconomics â</strong> it studies how aggregate economy is behaving and often studies inflation, GDP, national income and changes in unemployment.</li>
<li><strong>Microeconomics â </strong>this studies the economic tendencies or what is more likely to happen when someone makes certain decisions or when certain factors of production have been changed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Without strong economics, it can make some individuals be in a downward spiral of losing their finances and forced to contact <em><u>San Diego bankruptcy lawyers</u></em>.</p>

<div class="entry-caption"><p><p>In economics, <strong><em>you will constantly hear or read about GDP or the Gross Domestic Product</em></strong>. This is the total market value or monetary value of all finished goods as well as services that is produced within the countryâs territory in a given period of time. Here included all businesses regardless of its size and industry such as <em><u>property management companies Atlanta</u></em>. This is a broader scope of all the domestic production in a region and it acts as a thorough scorecard of how the economics of a country performs.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-156 lazyload" data-src="http://sentinelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/02-27-property-management-companies-atlanta.jpg" data-srcset="http://sentinelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/02-27-property-management-companies-atlanta.jpg 640w, http://sentinelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/02-27-property-management-companies-atlanta-300x200.jpg 300w" height="426" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20640%20426%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="640"/></p>
<h3><strong>A Deeper Look at GDP</strong></h3>
<p>Even though <u>GDP is calculated on a yearly basis</u>, it may be calculated as well every quarter. Just as example in the US, the government is releasing an <a href="/2020/02/11/the-development-of-cannabis-and-its-impact-on-new-york-economy/">annual estimate of its GDP</a> both every quarter and year. Majority of individual data sets will be given also in real terms. Meaning to say, the <strong>data will be adjusted as per price changes </strong>and therefore, the net of inflation.</p>
<h4><strong>GDP Basics</strong></h4>
<p>As mentioned earlier, <em>GDP is the total market and monetary value of all finished services and goods produced</em> for a given time in a country or region. This includes literally everything under its sovereign like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public and Private Consumption</strong></li>
<li><strong>Investments</strong></li>
<li><strong>Government Outlays</strong></li>
<li><strong>Additions to Private Inventories</strong></li>
<li><strong>Paid-in Construction Costs</strong></li>
<li><strong>Foreign Balance of Trades</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Types of Measurements for GDP</strong></h4>
<p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" class="__youtube_prefs__ epyt-is-override no-lazyload lazyload" data-no-lazy="1" data-origheight="360" data-origwidth="640" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rGqhTQyY6g4?enablejsapi=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;cc_lang_pref=&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;loop=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;autohide=2&amp;theme=dark&amp;color=red&amp;controls=1&amp;" height="360" id="_ytid_98693" title="YouTube player" width="640"></iframe></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Nominal GDP is basically how raw data is measured. Real GDP takes into consideration how inflation impacts a country and enables comparison of the economic output from the past years. Then GDP per capita is used in measuring GDP per person in national population which is quite useful in comparing GDP data among other countries.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Balance of trade is among the vital components of GDP formula for a country. GDP increased whenever the total value of services and goods that domestic producers make a successful sale to foreigners and it exceeded total value of foreign services and goods that the domestic consumers buy. This is otherwise called as trade surplus. If ever domestic consumers spent more on foreign products than what their domestic producers offer, this is a trade deficit and thus, it decreases the GDP.</p>
<h3><strong>Calculating GDP Based on Spending</strong></h3>
<p>Expenditure approach is otherwise called as <strong><u>spending approach</u></strong>. It is calculating spending by different groups operating within the economy. This approach could be calculated by applying the formula below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GDP</strong> = C + G + I + NX, or Consumption + Government Spending + Investment + Net Exports</li>
</ul>

<div class="entry-caption"><p><p>The <a href="/">economy runs like a madman</a> and the business world is crying out for staff, normally a good recipe for hefty pay increases. <strong>But they are not forthcoming, inflation is even higher. How is that possible?</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Labor Markets and Minimum Wage</strong></h2>
<p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" class="__youtube_prefs__ epyt-is-override no-lazyload lazyload" data-no-lazy="1" data-origheight="360" data-origwidth="640" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mWwXmH-n5Bo?enablejsapi=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;cc_lang_pref=&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;loop=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;autohide=2&amp;theme=dark&amp;color=red&amp;controls=1&amp;" height="360" id="_ytid_97176" title="YouTube player" width="640"></iframe></p>
<p>We would make some progress. Both the economy and the tax plans of Rutte III would give ordinary citizens a big boost. All those purchases that we could afford would drive the economy and business even further.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>But despite the economic boom of recent years, wages are rising less rapidly than inflation.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>In the first quarter, salaries rose on average 2.2 percent compared to the same period in 2018. But the money depreciation increased by 2.5 percent, so on balance, we fell 0.3 percent on average. And <strong>it looks like that gap is widening</strong>. In April, collective labor agreement wages rose 2.3 percent on an annual basis and prices 2.9 percent.</p>
<p><strong>The Central Planning Bureau hints that the forecasts for this year and 2020 will be adjusted next month.</strong> The calculators predicted a purchasing power increase of 1.6 percent so far, but with a four-month drop, it seems to be no longer an issue.</p>
<p><strong>This has to do with the governmentâs tax measures: especially the VAT increase and higher energy tax.</strong> Prime Minister Rutte promised to compensate for the extra costs for citizens, but that is not how the consumer works. He sees higher prices, reads about higher costs and adjusts his purchasing behavior accordingly.</p>
<h3><strong>Savings interest and pensions</strong></h3>
<p>Other issues, such as the pension crisis, with funds that have no longer indexed for years and are even in danger of having to shorten, also play a role in this. <strong>The inability of political and social partners to find a solution for this</strong> â let alone one that is easy on the citizen â makes older consumers especially cautious. The psychological and financial impact of the low-interest rates (https://newhorizons.co.uk/loans-for-bad-credit/no-guarantor-loans/), the moderate stock market climate and the tense housing market also play a role.</p>
<p><strong>This reluctance could already be deduced from consumer confidence.</strong> It has been in the red since February with the likely consequence that we are all keeping our hands on the bill, which is dampening economic growth.</p>
<p><strong>It is striking that our wages rise so moderately in times of economic boom.</strong> Yesterday it became clear that the number of vacancies has risen to a record level and that the number of vacancies is constantly increasing among employees who want to change jobs. Companies could influence that by simply offering more wages to switchers and newcomers.</p>
<h3><strong>Where are the trade unions?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>But society is changing in that regard: wages and status are not, as before, the main motivation for changing jobs.</strong> People in their twenties and thirties, with the tech industry at the forefront, are increasingly counting other issues. Such as company policy, location, working atmosphere, a balance between work and leisure, the secondary employment conditions. Many traditional companies are not well aware of this and therefore miss the battle on the labor market.</p>
<p>Moreover, with their waning supporters, <strong>the unions are increasingly less successful in keeping wage increases</strong> in line with profit increases at companies. Politics, with the middle-right signature of the past cabinets, also plays a cautious role in this.</p>
<p>This development is ominous because<strong> there are strong signals that we are heading for the next crisis.</strong> Then many companies will not even be able to offer employees financially anymore and consumers will only fall back.</p>

<div class="entry-caption"><p><p><em><u>GDP or Gross Domestic Product</u></em> is simply the total market or monetary value of all services like <em><u>private schools debt collection</u></em>, cleaning companies, contracting etc. and finished goods such as consumer electronics, automobile, textile and more that are produced within the country in a given period. GDP serves as a comprehensive tool for assessing the current economic health of a country.</p>
<p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" class="__youtube_prefs__ epyt-is-override no-lazyload lazyload" data-no-lazy="1" data-origheight="360" data-origwidth="640" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mjJmo5mN5yA?enablejsapi=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;cc_lang_pref=&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;loop=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;autohide=2&amp;theme=dark&amp;color=red&amp;controls=1&amp;" height="360" id="_ytid_77174" title="YouTube player" width="640"></iframe></p>
<p>Despite the fact that <strong>GDP is usually computed yearly</strong>, sometimes it is calculated every 3 months or per quarter. In United States for instance, the US government is releasing their annual GDP estimate for every fiscal quarter and also, for calendar year. The data presented in the report includes real-time information. In US, it is the <em><u>Bureau of Economic Analysis or BEA</u></em> that is tasked to compute the GDP. They do this by utilizing data ascertained via surveys of builders, retailers, manufacturers and also, by reading trade flows.</p>
<h3><strong>Biggest Contributor in GDP Calculation</strong></h3>
<p>Computing the GDP of a country is <em>encompassing all public and private consumption, investments, government outlays, paid-in construction costs, addition to private inventories, foreign balance of trade and everything in between</em>.</p>
<p>Out of all elements that compose the GDP of a country, foreign balance of trade is the most important. Countryâs GDP has the tendency to increase when its overall value of services and goods that domestic producers sell in other countries have exceeded the total value of the <a href="/2020/11/05/important-facts-about-u-s-motor-vehicle-insurance-polices-in-the-u-s/">foreign services</a> and goods that its domestic consumers are buying.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>When such thing happens, the country then have surplus in trade. Now, assuming that what happened is the opposite where the amount that the domestic consumers are spending on foreign products are larger than total sum of the domestic producers can sell to its foreign consumers, then this is referred to as trade deficit. In such cases, the GDP of the country is more likely to drop.</em></p></blockquote>
<h3><strong>Variations in Calculating GDP</strong></h3>
<p>There are many other ways of computing the GDP and some of it are:</p>
<p><strong>Nominal GPD â </strong>this is evaluated at the current price of the market either local or international. This is done using the currency market exchange rate to be able to compare the GDP of the country primarily in terms of financial terms.</p>
<p><strong>Purchasing Power Parity â </strong>short for PPP and is measured in international dollars. With this method, it is used to adjust the differences both in costs of living and local prices to be able ot make cross-country comparisons of real income, living standards and real output.</p>

<div class="entry-caption"><p><p>As a general rule, motor vehicle owners must carry a minimum insurance coverage to cover potential loss, damage or physical injury involving an owned vehicle. In the United States, the laws prescribing the policies and guidelines for motor vehicle insurance tend to vary, as each jurisdiction take into account different considerations in formulating statutory motor vehicle insurance laws.</p>

<h3><strong>Motor Vehicle Laws Vary in Every U.S. Jurisdiction</strong></h3>
<p>While nearly all U.S. jurisdictions have legislated laws governing motor vehicle insurance coverage, the states of Virginia, New Hampshire and Mississippi have distinct laws that may or may not require vehicle owners to take out a car insurance policy. Below are the key takeaways of car insurance policies in the three states:</p>
<p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" class="__youtube_prefs__ epyt-is-override no-lazyload lazyload" data-no-lazy="1" data-origheight="360" data-origwidth="640" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yYHB459s1aU?enablejsapi=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;cc_lang_pref=&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;loop=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;autohide=2&amp;theme=dark&amp;color=red&amp;controls=1&amp;" height="360" id="_ytid_16927" title="YouTube player" width="640"></iframe></p>
<h4><strong>Virginia</strong></h4>
<p>The government of Virginia does not require car owners to obtain motor vehicle insurance, car owners are instead required to additionally pay the state Department of Motor Vehicle (DMV) an Uninsured Motor Vehicle Fee of $500 on top of the regular vehicle registration fees.</p>
<p>The additional $500 though, is not for the purpose of securing a state-provided vehicle insurance. In the event that an uninsured car figures in a car accident, the owner of the car is personally liable for any resulting property damages or bodily injury or injuries.</p>
<p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" class="__youtube_prefs__ epyt-is-override no-lazyload lazyload" data-no-lazy="1" data-origheight="360" data-origwidth="640" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p6HLE9NTr9M?enablejsapi=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;cc_lang_pref=&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;loop=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;autohide=2&amp;theme=dark&amp;color=red&amp;controls=1&amp;" height="360" id="_ytid_93980" title="YouTube player" width="640"></iframe></p>
<h4><strong>New Hampshire</strong></h4>
<p>In New Hampshire, obtaining a motor vehicle insurance is not mandatory. However, the exemption does not apply to car owners who have been convicted of serious misdemeanors such as Driving Under the Influence (DUI), hit-and run accidents or a second citation/ticket for speeding violation.</p>
<p>In cases when a car insurance coverage is a requirement, the vehicle owner must obtain a minimum amount of $25,000 third-party liability insurance per person, up to a maximum of $50,000 coverage; and a minimum $25,000 for property damage for every accident involving a motor vehicle. In addition, a required insurance coverage must include a minimum$1,000 coverage for medical payments.</p>
<h4><strong>Mississippi</strong></h4>
<p>The state of Mississippi requires all motor vehicle drivers to carry and maintain liability car insurance that is strictly in accordance with the prescribed minimum amounts of coverage required by the state. They are similar to New Hampshireâs, $25,000 third-party liability coverage for bodily injury or death per person, up to a maximum of $50,000 for death or total bodily injury plus a minimum $25,000 coverage for property damages.</p>
<h3><strong>Factors that Affect the Cost of Auto Insurance In Each State</strong></h3>
<p>Insurance information website <strong>carinsurancesnearme.com </strong>furnishes information about <strong><a href="http://sentinelblog.com/2017/05/15/the-united-states-of-goldman-sachs/">United States</a></strong> jurisdictions that have the most expensive as well as the least expensive cost of motor vehicle insurance. That being the case, the state in which a car insurance holder resides is a determining factor in evaluating the cost of insurance required.</p>
<p>As it is, while car insurance providers normally take into consideration the make of the vehicle, and the car ownerâs driving <strong><a href="http://sentinelblog.com/2017/01/19/56-years-ago-today-eisenhower-warned-americans-of-the-unwarranted-influence-of-the-deep-state/">history</a></strong>, age, gender, marital status and credit score, there are certain state-specific factors that insurance providers also consider in calculating their risk.</p>
<p>Examples of such factors include state insurance laws, crime rates, claim rates and the related statistics pertaining to vehicular accidents and number of uninsured drivers in the state in which the insurance coverage applies.</p>
<p>When such state-specific factors are present, calculation of insurance risks will also take into account the location/s where a car owner usually drives to as well as the frequency by which he drives to high-risk locations. When the risks calculations yield a high risk score, the insurance provider increases the monthly insurance premiums. Needless to stay, low risk scores correspondingly have lower monthly premiums.</p>
<p>Those being examples of factors that can influence the cost of a car insurance policy, Car Insurance Near Me suggests that when buying a new car, it would be wiser to shop around for car insurance policies that could cost lower than the car insurance policy will include as part of the sales deal.</p>

Some are easy to obtain while others a more difficult.</strong> Knowing what you need, where to find them, as well as how to obtain one is particularly crucial especially when you require immediate funds for unforeseen expenses.</p>

Hence, you could immediately get hold of the funds you need to finance your immediate expenses.</p>
<h2>Small Personal Loan â What Is It?</h2>
<p><strong>A small loan, to put it in simple terms, is a kind of personal loan that does not need any sort of collateral.</strong> Hence, it is also called an âunsecured loan.â While there is no definite or set amount, the loanable amount will depend on the financial institution or lender and the type of small personal loan they offer.</p>
<p><strong>Although small loans donât require any collateral and only necessitate a few requirements to avail, qualify and be granted, the interest rates are usually higher</strong> because the financial institution or lender are more at risk than the borrower. But then again, some lenders or financial institution offer small loans with very favorable terms making it easier for the borrower to repay. However, as there are only a few options, it may be difficult to find a small loan with very agreeable terms.</p>
<h3><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-238 lazyload" data-src="http://sentinelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/funds-231x300.png" data-srcset="http://sentinelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/funds-231x300.png 231w, http://sentinelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/funds.png 493w" height="300" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20231%20300%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="231"/>Small Personal Loans â Where To Get Them?</h3>
<p>While several lenders only offer larger loans, there are numerous places to visit for a small personal loan. Letâs have a look at some:</p>
<h4>CREDIT UNIONS AND BANKS</h4>
<p>Several traditional banks as well as credit unions offer small personal loans, wherein some begin with an online application however require you to personally visit their physical branch prior to the funds being released. Also, several credit unions offer payday loans that might help you obtain a small loan even thigh your credit score/rating isnât good.</p>
<h4>ONLINE LENDERS</h4>

It might take a few days for the process and your application be completed and the funds to be transferred to your bank account.</p>
<h4>PEER-TO-PEER LENDERS (P2P)</h4>
<p>P2P lenders operate online and these online lending platforms match up borrowers with potential investors who are willing provide the loan. With P2P lending platforms, the interest rates are usually low and the process is quick. However, note that not every P2P lending platforms offer small loans.</p>
<h4>PAYDAY LOANS</h4>
<p>For really small loans, like $500 or eve less, payday loans might be an option. However, this type of loan is a very expensive choice because of the high fees tied to it. So, make this option your last-ditch effort if you arenât able to qualify for small loans elsewhere.</p>
<h4>LINES OF CREDIT OR INSTALLMENT LOANS</h4>

Although these types of loans are cheaper compared to payday loans, this should also be your last option because of the high interest rate which could make it really difficult for you to pay off.</p>
<p>Itâs always best to shop around and compare requirements, conditions and terms when looking for a small loan.</p>

<div class="entry-caption"><p><p><strong>The world financial and economic system was on the brink.</strong> Questionable speculation business with American home loans turned into a global liquidity and confidence crisis between the banks. The <a href="/2017/02/06/is-trump-about-to-cause-another-crisis-2008-could-be-eclipsed-as-bank-restrictions-eliminated/">financial crisis</a> kept the world in suspense for many months. The stock prices tumbled into the basement, one large financial house after the other reported billions in depreciation, or had to file for bankruptcy. New bad news reached the financial markets almost every day. Governments around the world tried to calm the panicked financial world. Solutions were sought at national, European, and international levels to limit the extent of the financial and economic crisis. Gross domestic product in Germany in 2009 was five percent lower than in the previous year. This was the sharpest decline in the post-war period.</p>
<h2 class="title style-scope ytd-video-primary-info-renderer"><strong>The 2008 Financial Crisis: Crash Course Economics</strong></h2>
<p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" class="__youtube_prefs__ epyt-is-override no-lazyload lazyload" data-no-lazy="1" data-origheight="360" data-origwidth="640" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GPOv72Awo68?enablejsapi=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;cc_lang_pref=&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;loop=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;autohide=2&amp;theme=dark&amp;color=red&amp;controls=1&amp;" height="360" id="_ytid_73018" title="YouTube player" width="640"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>The central banks steered against the crisis with a policy of cheap money.</strong> The taxpayer paid for the crisis. The German taxpayer was there with around 60 billion euros. Banks were supported by government billions. The consequences of the weakening economy â falling tax revenues, skyrocketing unemployment, rising social spending and billions of bailouts for banks â are putting a strain on national budgets, particularly in the weaker countries of the euro area. The result was the euro crisis. One eurozone after the other threatened to slide into insolvency. Due to the European Central Bankâs (ECB) low-interest-rate policy, savers lost hundreds of billions in lost interest, but loans were cheap. Investors migrated to the stock and real estate markets. The DAX has tripled since 2009, real estate is more expensive than ever before.</p>
<p><strong>The world was in the worst financial and economic crisis since the 1930s.</strong> Then as now, there was too much speculation, too much trust in the mechanisms of the financial markets, and too little regulation of those who had started the crisis. The stock prices tumbled into the basement, one large financial house after the other reported billions in depreciation, or had to file for bankruptcy. New bad news reaches the financial markets almost every day.</p>
<p>Governments around the world tried to calm the panicked financial world and restore trust among consumers. Solutions were sought at national, European, and international levels to limit the extent of the crisis.</p>
<h3><strong>How did the financial crisis come about?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The subprime crisis is seen as a trigger for the global financial and economic crisis.</strong> Years of rising real estate prices in the United States, which had developed into a real estate bubble, stagnated and even fell in certain areas. At the same time, more and more borrowers could no longer service their loan installments, partly because of rising interest rates and partly because of a lack of income. Problematic borrowers (subprime â mortgage loans with low credit ratings) were charged with higher and higher interest rates after initially low-interest rates. With a debt rescheduling, the expensive loan for the property, which has now increased in value, should be repaid and a new loan should be taken out. However, real estate prices collapsed in mid-2006 and the business model no longer worked.</p>
<p><strong>The situation was aggravated by daring constructions.</strong> In order to refinance themselves, the real estate banks bundled the high-risk loans into new types of securities that were sold to investors worldwide. These securities were initially rated as low-risk by rating agencies â but in the course of the real estate crisis, the securities were rated increasingly poorly, leading to corresponding losses in the banksâ balance sheets.</p>
<p>More and more <strong>subprime loans (low-quality mortgage loans)</strong> burst, confidence in the value of the securities allegedly secured by US mortgage contracts fell â and with it their price on the markets. As a result, banks sometimes had to drastically correct the values ââof these papers in their books, which resulted in deep red numbers in the balance sheets. Two hedge funds from New York investment bank Bear Stearns had speculated because they were heavily involved in the property-backed paper.</p>
<p>In Germany, Mittelstandsbank IKB, HSH Nordbank, SachsenLB, WestLB, Landesbank Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg and BayernLB, both under public law, came into crisis because of <strong>false speculation on the US real estate market</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>In September 2008, the events rushed.</strong> The US government had to take control of the bankrupt US mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. On September 15, 2008, 158-year-old Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, while competitor Merrill Lynch was bought out by Bank of America. The US leading index Dow Jones suffered the biggest daily loss since September 11, 2001. Next, the US insurance company AIG was hit by capital losses and was only saved by a loan from the US Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>While today, the world is facing another threat of financial crisis, the government and private institutions like https://looselending.com/ are coming up with plans to help small businesses through loans.</p>

<div class="entry-caption"><p><p><strong><em>Hoarding phase has finally settled</em></strong>. Now, the realities of social as well as physical distancing and the pandemic that Covid-19 brought are settling in. You may now wonder whether it is still good to buy your âwantsâ during these times. Perhaps, you are thinking hard if you should push through for a major purchase such as a new car or a new home.</p>
<p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" class="__youtube_prefs__ epyt-is-override no-lazyload lazyload" data-no-lazy="1" data-origheight="360" data-origwidth="640" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OFyQ0eepHNU?enablejsapi=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;cc_lang_pref=&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;loop=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;autohide=2&amp;theme=dark&amp;color=red&amp;controls=1&amp;" height="360" id="_ytid_18504" title="YouTube player" width="640"></iframe></p>
<p>Taking the dive on major purchases throughout this time is still like <u>trying to navigate on uncharted waters</u>. The same is true for financial experts. However as per their expert advice among families who are looking forward to spend their money regardless of the situation will depend on the situation.</p>
<h3><strong>Focus on the Essentials First</strong></h3>
<p>Does your pay cut off or has unfortunately lost your job? If yes, now may not be the ideal time to worry about the next purchase you should make aside from necessities similar to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Housing</strong></li>
<li><strong>Food</strong></li>
<li><strong>Utilities</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In the event that you are already struggling to stay afloat on a day to day basis meeting these necessities, then <strong>making a new purchase of that âwantâ is probably out of the equation</strong>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you are blessed to be part of those lucky <a href="/2020/05/17/binary-options-trading-gaining-popularity-amidst-covid-19-crisis/"><u>people who were quick to adjust</u></a> to a âwork from homeâ setup or was just able to keep their employment, then most probably, your income is still intact.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Regardless, if the economy hampered, rest assured that the ripples could be widespread and delayed. With this in mind, financial experts agree that it is better to take every decision with caution, even though if thereâs a Coronavirus relief program.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Say for example that you are in a bad financial shape no matter if the pandemic is to be blamed or not, buying high-priced items like a new car or going on a vacation will never be a smart move.</p>
<h4><strong>Revisiting Your Goals</strong></h4>
<p>In these times of pandemic, <strong><u>there is a high possibility that you are heavily relying on your credit card while sticking to a hair-tight budget</u></strong>. This makes it the perfect time to make reevaluation of your financial goals.</p>
<p>According to experts, the primary objective among families in such time is <em>preserving flexibility of cash flow</em> no matter whether your finances are impacted or not. Meaning to say, being able to have cash on hand if things go south. Additionally, it may mean to <strong>delay some major purchases</strong> that you have planned long ago, monitoring your spending and come up with a pandemic budget for essentials and food in short term.</p>
<p>Just in case that all else fails, you may try getting a loan at https://www.southeasttitleloans.com to cover for some expenses.</p>

<p><strong>The chances for the growth of economics in New York City is one of the most debatable arguments in legalizing marijuana</strong>. Based on studies, around 63.4 percent of adults say that legalization of marijuana would be justified through the <em>creation of the industry and the related jobs.</em> Furthermore, the act for legalizing marijuana offers a natural study on the economic progress of the industry. The new industry for marijuana is such a rare case for now thus, creation of supply chain must be implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>The Supply Chain of Medical Marijuana in New York</h3>
<blockquote><p>The medical marijuana has been legalized in New York in July 2014.</p></blockquote>
<p>Due to the legalization of medical marijuana in New York and receiving five licenses after a year, the demand for it is really high. Likewise, <strong>the integration of the marijuana supply chain is very much required</strong>. Actually, there are <em>32 dispensaries that are allowed to operate in New York.</em> The New York State Department of Health Laboratory for medical marijuana works collaboratively with New York City. They aim to <em>identify authorized and certified laboratories to perform potency testing and contaminants evaluation.</em></p>
<h3>The Impact of Marijuana in the Economy of New York</h3>
<p>The economic impact of the adult-use of marijuana needs the target market size. Below are its possible effect:</p>
<h4>1. Employment</h4>
<p>Based on the employment report of New York State, <strong>there are actually 12.4 employees in every $1 million cannabis sales.</strong> Therefore, if there is $1.7 billion cannabis market in New York, <em>approximate employment of 21,080 employees would be possible</em>. They can be deployed in cultivation areas, manufacturing plants, laboratories, and dispensaries.</p>

<h4>2. Growth on investment</h4>
<p>Generally, the utilization of cannabis demands for monetary investments to support big cultivation companies within the state. One company, the <strong>Etain LLC</strong>, is having a plan to <em>put up manufacturing facility of medical marijuana around Warren County, New York.</em> This would cost for about $9 million investment that would be an adjunct to the existing $4 million growing areas. So, if you are thinking <a href="http://sentinelblog.com/2019/11/22/where-to-invest-this-decade/">where to invest this decade</a>, this one seems to be a good option. You may also visit Stocktrades for more information.</p>
<h4>3. Effect on the economic output</h4>
<p>The industry of cannabis will maintain its progress and will also go through the economic state. <em>Marijuana industry will continue to procure supplies from suppliers located in New York. </em>Those employers within the industry will put their earnings on their locality and their own economy.</p>

<div class="entry-caption"><p><p>Thinking of <strong><a href="/2019/11/22/where-to-invest-this-decade/">doing business</a> with loan sharks</strong> to fill up your financial needs? Well best to consider other financial options available. As much as possible, <em>avoid transacting with them</em>. These lenders are unlicensed and implement high rates of interest. Most cases, they are pressuring and threatening borrowers to frighten them and repay their loans. Given that these lenders arenât licensed, it is, therefore, safe to say that they are transacting illegally.</p>
<p>Rather than falling to the hands of these businesses, it is preferable to <strong><u>seek financial services</u></strong> offered by https://mycaraccidentcashadvance.com/ wherein you can be certain that they are licensed.</p>
<p>The thing is, there are instances in which loan sharks is the only viable option available. When such time comes, how would you react and transact with these financial institutions? Good thing for you, there are tips that can help you in dealing with them.</p>
<p><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" class="__youtube_prefs__ epyt-is-override no-lazyload lazyload" data-no-lazy="1" data-origheight="360" data-origwidth="640" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jf4zGjJ4eXs?enablejsapi=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;cc_lang_pref=&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;loop=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;autohide=2&amp;theme=dark&amp;color=red&amp;controls=1&amp;" height="360" id="_ytid_66696" title="YouTube player" width="640"></iframe></p>
<h3><strong>Seek Help from a Financial Expert</strong></h3>
<p>It is recommended to <em><u>consult with legal financial experts</u></em> regardless of what your lending concerns are. When doing so, you are able to steer clear of dealing with loan sharks. At the same time, you will be enlightened with other ways of borrowing money from your loan advisor. <strong>Keep in mind that thereâs nothing wrong in taking a loan</strong>. This is given that you know where you are getting your personal loan and on how you will be managing the money you borrowed.</p>
<p><strong>Is the Lender Legitimate?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Part of your job is to confirm that the lender is legit.</strong> Have you recognized that there are many loan sharks who are presenting themselves as a licensed lender? But after performing thorough investigation, youâll be surprised that they turned out to be illegal.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-139 lazyload" data-src="http://sentinelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/01-16-cash-advance.jpg" data-srcset="http://sentinelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/01-16-cash-advance.jpg 640w, http://sentinelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/01-16-cash-advance-300x169.jpg 300w" height="360" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20640%20360%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="640"/></p>
<p><em>See to it that the lender is certified</em>. They must secure lending licensed thatâs issued by the government. If such information is lacking, then you may consider this is as a red flag. Therefore, it is preferable if you would stop transacting with them right there and then.</p>
<h3><strong>Donât Panic</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p><em>The very first thing you have to do is to keep your posture. Never let the loan sharks see that you are aware of their efforts of trickery. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>Doing this may put you into risks and more problems.</p>
<h3><strong>No More Payments!</strong></h3>
<p>As you <strong>report your predicament to the right authority</strong>, it is preferable to stop making payments for your debt. Since these loan sharks are illegally transacting, it only indicates that theyâve got no rights in lending money or receiving payments to their debtors. You have to know your rights and the law being a borrower.</p>

<hr/>
<p>The Asia-Pacific region has never been this unstable for the past 20 years. Theses two American allies in the east are not in good terms that it might affect the stability of the region. What couldâve been the reason behind this ruse between these two Asian powerhouses?</p>

<p>The red dragon is finally awake and is now challenging current world superpowers. The Chinese have been dealing with their neighbors with a contemptuous motive of yielding its power through lending them a large amount of money with hefty interest rates and you know whatâs next.</p>
